# ecom-recommendation-task
Open sourcing a e-commerece recommendation engine task
# System Design 

# Built with
Python, Postgres, Milvus and runs in docker containers

# Flaws
One part that was missed during creation of the task was to remove data points that are self-pointed recommendations. 
This should not happen.
